    "TASK": "These days, traffic accidents are more and more serious. What are the causes and how could this problem be solved?",
    "ANSWER": {
        "INTRODUCTION": "In this day and age, the appearance of social problems will affect directly our life and many aspects such as education, entertainment, working, the environment, finance, and health. The topic is that these days, traffic accidents are becoming more and more serious. This discussion surrounding this problem will be clarified in the essay.",
        "BODY": {
            "OPINION_1": "There are some reasons related to this problem. Beginning with individuals, teenagers are not old enough to control vehicles, and they often use wine and beer before riding motorbikes. This lack of responsibility and maturity leads to dangerous driving behaviors. About the government, they do not have strict laws to reduce the problems of traffic accidents in big cities. The absence of stringent regulations and enforcement allows for reckless driving to go unchecked. These issues contribute to an increasing number of traffic accidents, which negatively impacts the quality of life and public safety.",
            "OPINION_2": "However, there are also some convincing solutions for this problem. Beginning with individuals, the young should read books and study about traffic safety laws when they use transportation. By educating themselves about the rules and the importance of safe driving, they can become more responsible drivers. About the government, they should increase the age of driving for the young and limit the age for the elderly in driving. Implementing such policies would ensure that only those who are adequately capable and responsible are allowed to drive. Additionally, the government should enforce stricter laws and penalties for traffic violations to deter reckless driving."
        },
        "CONCLUSION": "In summary, every single situation will consist of both advantages and disadvantages. From my point of view, we need to consider the pros and minimize the cons of the problem. Addressing the causes of traffic accidents and implementing effective solutions can significantly reduce their occurrence and improve public safety."
